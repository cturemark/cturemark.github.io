              <h4> GRADUATION EXHIBITION <br>
                <br>
                Every year, the graduating Graphic Design class from Malmö University gets to exhibit   <br>
                their thesis work at Form/Deign Centre in Malmö. The class of 2020 graduates, in a time when   <br>
                social distancing has placed a screen between ourselves and the outside world, had to rethink   <br>
                the idea of a physical exhibition. This is the result of our virtual exhibition(s). The exhibition   <br>
                was put together and organized by three students and our supervisors. We - the students – were   <br>
                responsible for the main organization, website and poster design, text editing for all the individual  <br>
                 projects, video editing and last but not least printing the exhibition poster on a Risograph.  <br>
                 <br>
                 As the theme for the exhibition, we used a future yet retro aspect of screens to highlight  <br>
                 how they connect and divide us. The screens are a rectangular rabbit holes; through which we   <br>
                 collaborate, stay informed, manage our studies, mediate daily life, stream series and spend time   <br>
                 with near and dear ones, all within a gleaming light.<br>
                 <br>
                 The website and showcased works have been appreciated by students and teachers from the <br>
                 university as well as acknowledged and appreciated by others.
