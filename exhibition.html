              <h4> GRADUATION EXHIBITION // Screen Gleaming<br>
                <br>
                Every year, the graduating Graphic Design class from Malmö University gets to exhibit <br>
                their thesis work at Form/Design Center in Malmö. The graduates of the class of 2020, <br>
                in a time where social media has placed a screen between outselves and the outside world, <br>
                had to rethink the idea of a physical exhibition. This is the result of our virtual exhibition(s).<br>
                The exhibition was put together and organized by three students and our supervisors. <br>
                We - the students – were responsible for the main organization, website and poster design, <br>
                text editing for all the individual projects, video editing and last but not least printing <br>
                the exhibition poster on a Risograph. <br>
                <br>
                As the theme for the exhibition, we used a future yet retro aspect of screens to highlight <br>
                how they connect and divide us. The screens are a rectangular rabbit holes; through which we <br>
                collaborate, stay informed, manage our studies, mediate daily life, stream series and spend <br>
                time with near and dear ones, all within a gleaming light.<br>
                <br>
                The website and showcased works have been appreciated by students and teachers from <br>
                Malmö University as well as gained external acknowledgement.
