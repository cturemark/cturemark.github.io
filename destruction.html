              <h4> TYPEFACE DESIGN // Destruction <br>
                <br>
                In protest movements, images and text are used to send a message, but can a <br>
                typeface alone send a message? This is what I wanted to explore in my project. <br>
                To create a typeface connected to a specific movement that would tell a story<br>
                 with the letters themselves.<br>
<br>
                In 2018 I was invited to attend the Memorial Peace Ceremony in Hiroshima. <br>
                Sitting at the ceremony, I realized I had a huge lack of knowledge regarding this <br>
                tragedy. So my own lack of knowledge was the starting point in my historical <br>
                research on the design and symbols used in the anti-nuclear movement. I wanted <br>
                to highlight the fact that the anti-nuclear movement is not a movement frozen in the past.<br>
                <br>
                A lot of the visual research I found were images of maps visualizing the damages<br>
                from an above perspective. I wanted to get down to ground level and visualize from <br>
                a ground perspective in an attempted to somehow make it more human. <br>
<br>
                The aim with Destruction is to bring attention to this movement. Nuclear weapons <br>
                is not an issue that regards some people more than others, a potential attack <br>
                will affect all humans and our planet.
