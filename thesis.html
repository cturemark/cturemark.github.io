              <p> THE MAP IS NOT THE TERRITORY / BA THESIS PROJECT<br>
                <br>
                  Some design is being questioned and some is taken for granted – like maps.
                  Maps are a visualization of our complex surroundings that we’re trying to
                  make sense of and mapping somehow makes it more comprehensible. The most
                  common map is the one portraying a physical space. The representation of that
                  space needs to be reduced for the map to be readable. Just like graphic design,
                  the purpose of the map is to tell a story. Does the viewer of the map ever think
                  of this? My goal with this project is to question the power of both the map and
                  the designer and to make the viewer of the map inquisitive. Do you recognize that
                  the map you include in our everyday life is interpreted by the creator and intends
                  to portray one of many ways of presenting reality? To emphasize the fact that maps
                  ave gone from a tradition of drawing maps by hand, to the way Google Maps is now
                  an obvious part of our everyday life; this book consists of selected text written
                  by experts within the field of cartography that have been combined with carefully
                  chosen maps. To guide the reader, the book includes some helpful words written by
                  me to combine the writings of the experts and the maps. To highlight the shift from
                  printed to digital media the book has some Augmented Reality effects built into it.

                  This project consists of two parts, the book and an academic paper (in Swedish).
                  The paper is available here:
