              <h4> BFA THESIS PROJECT // The Map Is Not the Territory <br>
                <br>
                  Some design is being questioned and some is taken for granted – like maps. <br>
                  Maps are a visualization of our complex surroundings that we’re trying to <br>
                  make sense of and mapping somehow makes it more comprehensible. The most <br>
                  common map is the one portraying a physical space. The representation of that <br>
                  space needs to be reduced for the map to be readable. Just like graphic design, <br>
                  the purpose of the map is to tell a story. Does the viewer of the map ever think <br>
                  of this? My goal with this project is to question the power of both the map and <br>
                  the designer and to make the viewer of the map inquisitive. Do you recognize that<br>
                  the map you include in our everyday life is interpreted by the creator and intends <br>
                  to portray one of many ways of presenting reality? To emphasize the fact that maps <br>
                  ave gone from a tradition of drawing maps by hand, to the way Google Maps is now <br>
                  an obvious part of our everyday life; this book consists of selected text written<br>
                  by experts within the field of cartography that have been combined with carefully <br>
                  chosen maps. To guide the reader, the book includes some helpful words written by <br>
                  me to combine the writings of the experts and the maps. To highlight the shift from<br>
                  printed to digital media the book has some Augmented Reality effects built into it.
